1. Create a 2D spot light
2. Position the light
3. Add a trigger colider to the light
	If the light is 360 degrees, use a circle colider, radius will be equal to the light radius
	If not, a polygon collider must be to the lit area set manually
4. IMPORTANT: Set light to ignore raycast layer (Seriously, I forgot and spent like, 2 hours trying to fix this.)
